What is WorkOnIt?\n
WorkOnIt helps you build (or break) habits with the least friction: add a goal, jot quick notes, mark today as done, rate your day, and—when you need it—get a short boost of AI chizzuk.\n\n

How to use it (quick start):\n
• Add a goal: tap the + on the main screen → give it a name → choose Type:\n
  • Positive = do this (e.g., “learn 15 min”).\n
  • Negative = avoid this (e.g., “no late scrolling”).\n
  • Set “times/week” as a target (optional) and save.\n
• Goal details:\n
  • Notes: write anything you want to remember or reflect on.\n
  • Did you achieve today? tick the checkbox when you’ve done/avoided it.\n
  • Get Chizzuk 💪: tap to generate a short, warm encouragement (notes help tailor it).\n
  • Rate Progress: slide Difficulty, Motivation, and Success (0–10) for today.\n
• Calendar:\n
  • View past days and see saved ratings for any date.\n
  • Tap “Rate this day” to log a rating for a specific date.\n\n

Tips:\n
• Keep goal names short and specific (e.g., “walk 10 min”).\n
• Use Notes to capture patterns or triggers.\n
• “Times/week” is a guide—no hard enforcement—so be honest and kind to yourself.\n\n

Data &amp; privacy:\n
• Your notes, checkboxes, and ratings are stored locally on your device (SharedPreferences).\n
• AI chizzuk is generated online; an internet connection is required when you tap it.\n\n
